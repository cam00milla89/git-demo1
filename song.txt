All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot headed believer
I threw my hands in the air said show me something
She said if you dare come a little closer

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me out the way

It's not much of a life you're living
Not just something you take it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now, you know
